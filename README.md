## Description
This is a demonstration of a PWA (Progressive Web Application).  It's a simple text editor.  What's special (and what makes it a PWA) is that it uses webpack and caching to run on new and older browsers, run without an internet connection, and offers the ability to install it as a standalone app on your device that runs exactly as well as it would on a browser.  It also makes use of an indexedDB.


## Deployment
